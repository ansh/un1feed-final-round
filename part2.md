Let say you have a user Bob who follows 1000 people on Twitter.

You have access to 2 API endpoints:

1. statuses/home_timeline which can give you X most recent tweets sorted in chronological order for ALL 1000 people Bob follows
2. statuses/user_timeline which gives you X most recent tweets for 1 person via their username

Bob wants to only see Tweets from 200 of the 1000 people on Twitter but he does not want to unfollow any of the people.
